## Notes

One challenge encountered while building the app was ensuring that the site remained fully responsive across different screen sizes, particularly when displaying high-quality images on smaller mobile devices. Adjusting the grid layout to work smoothly on both desktop and mobile was another key focus. Additionally, finding the right balance between aesthetic appeal and functionality required careful consideration, especially in the styling of the card components.
